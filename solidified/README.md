# Solidified — Hubzilla SPA Theme

A [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) single-page application (SPA) that ships as the **Solidified** theme for [Hubzilla](https://framagit.org/hubzilla/core), a federated social networking platform. It replaces the classic server-rendered UI with a fast, reactive client-side experience while staying fully integrated with Hubzilla's PHP backend.

> The compiled theme is distributed at **[saiwal/Utsukta-hub-themes](https://github.com/saiwal/Utsukta-hub-themes)** on GitHub.

## Rich Text Editor

The editor powers post, comment, article, and webpage composition. It shares a single implementation across all composer variants.

**Three tabs:**
- **WYSIWYG** — contenteditable with toolbar
- **Source** — raw markup (BBCode, HTML, or Markdown)
- **Preview** — rendered read-only output

**Toolbar (full level — posts and articles):**
Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Highlight, Link, Bullet list, Numbered list, H2, H3, Blockquote, Code block, Align left, Align center, Clear formatting

**Comment level** strips structural formatting and shows only inline styles.

**Attachment system:**
- Upload files directly or pick from the cloud files library or photos library
- Tabbed picker modal with multi-select
- Inline thumbnail previews with upload progress and alt-text support
- Per-attachment ACL (allow/deny channels and privacy groups)

**Other editor features:**
- `@`-mention autocomplete with live user search
- Draft auto-save to IndexedDB, keyed per composer scope — survives page refresh
- Ctrl+Enter to submit
- ACL picker for post-level access control (privacy groups, individual channels)
- Category tagging on posts and articles

---

## Feed & Stream

All stream views (network, channel, public, HQ) share the same underlying store and PostCard component.

**View modes** — toggle between Feed, Masonry (grid), List (compact), and Inbox.

**PostCard actions:**
- Like / Dislike (with live count)
- Repeat with dropdown variants
- Reshare with optional added text
- Inline comment composer (threaded)
- Star (bookmarks, local users only)
- Follow / Unfollow author
- Delete (author only, federated)
- Copy link, View source, Refresh post

**Thread rendering:**
- Threaded or flat comment display, toggled per post
- Lazy-loaded comments (load most-recent N, then expand)
- Thread tree building with parent–child hierarchy
- Event posts detected from BBCode and rendered as event cards
- Attachment galleries (images, files) inline

**Stream controls:**
- Background polling for new posts
- Pagination / infinite scroll
- Filter chips (starred, DMs, unread, spam, followed threads, privacy group…)
- Sidebar widgets for categories, tags, and popular posts

## Theming

22 built-in themes plus full custom mode. Theme preference is stored in both localStorage (instant restore, no flash on reload) and the server (`/api/settings/display`) so it follows the user across devices.

| Category | Themes |
|---|---|
| Light | Light, Pastel Soft, Warm Paper, Mint Fresh, Sakura, Latte Cream, Gruvbox Light, Catppuccin Latte, Solarized Light |
| Dark | Dark, Nord, Dracula, Monokai, One Dark, CyberPunk, Rose Pine, Gruvbox Dark, Catppuccin Mocha, Solarized Dark, Tokyo Night, Matrix |
| Custom | User-defined CSS variables (base, text, accent, surfaces) stored as a JSON blob |

Themes are implemented as CSS custom properties on `data-theme` and integrate with Tailwind CSS v4 utilities throughout.

---

## Responsive Layout

| Breakpoint | Layout |
|---|---|
| Mobile (`< 768px`) | Single column, bottom tab bar (4 items), "More" drawer |
| Tablet (`768px – 1279px`) | Single column, collapsible right sidebar via FAB |
| Desktop (`≥ 1280px`) | Three-column: left nav (fixed) · main content · right sidebar (fixed) |

**Sidebar slots** — modules inject widgets into named regions:
- `right` — contextual right sidebar (per-module + global)
- `rightVisitor` — visitor-only right sidebar
- `leftBottom` — left sidebar footer area
- `mainTop` — owner-only content above the main feed
- `help` — help overlay integration

---

## Progressive Web App

- Service worker built with [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/) — asset caching for offline-capable use
- Update detection: a toast prompts the user to reload when a new version is available
- Push notification support
- Web app manifest for installability

---

## Internationalization

Two full locales ship out of the box:

| Code | Language | Script |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English | Latin |
| `hi` | Hindi | Devanagari |

Translations are organized into namespace files (`nav`, `layout`, `ui`, `widgets`, `tools`). Locale preference is saved to localStorage (`hz-locale`). Adding a new locale means creating matching namespace files and registering the locale label — no framework changes needed.

---

## Installation Gating

Modules that correspond to optional Hubzilla apps are silently suppressed when the user has not installed that app. The `/api/nav` response returns `installed_apps: string[]`; any module whose `appName` is absent from that list has its routes redirected to `/` and its sidebar widgets hidden.

| Module | Required Hubzilla app |
|---|---|
| Articles | `Articles` |
| Calendar | `Calendar` |
| Chat | `Chatrooms` |
| Files | `Files` |
| Photos | `Photos` |
| Public Stream | `Public Stream` |
| Webpages | `Webpages` |
| Wiki | `Wiki` |

Modules without an `appName` (channel, network, settings, admin, etc.) are always active.

---

## PHP Backend (`src/Api/`)

A PHP API layer ships alongside the SPA as `Theme\Solidified\Api` inside the Hubzilla theme. It extends Hubzilla's native API with SPA-specific endpoints.

**Key handlers:** `Network`, `Channel`, `Item`, `Nav`, `Settings`, `Profile`, `Photos`, `Files`, `Articles`, `Chat`, `Cal`, `Wiki`, `Webpages`, `Admin`, `Manage`, `Directory`, `Display`, `Pubstream`, `Siteinfo`, `Sw`, `Manifest`

All responses use a consistent JSON envelope — `Response::send()`, `Response::paginate()`, `Response::error()` — with CSRF protection on all mutation endpoints.

## Getting Started (Development)

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, a running Hubzilla instance.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # Dev server at http://localhost:5173
                  # Proxies /api → https://hz-ddev.ddev.site
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server with API proxy |
| `npm run build` | Production build (`tsc -b && vite build`) |
| `npm run build:all` | Production build + service worker |
| `npm run build:sw` | Build service worker only |
| `npm run watch` | Watch mode build |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check with watch |

### Build Output

Vite outputs to `../hz-ddev/core/extend/theme/utsukta-themes/solidified/assets/` (configurable in `vite.config.ts`):

```
assets/
├── app.js           # Main entry
├── app-[name].js    # Code-split chunks
└── app.css          # Styles
```

Static docs and the PHP `src/Api/` directory are copied to the theme root via `vite-plugin-static-copy`.

### Adding a Module

```typescript
// src/modules/myfeature/index.ts
import { registerModule } from "@/shared/lib/module-registry";

registerModule({
  id: "myfeature",
  routes: [{ path: "/myfeature", component: () => import("./views/MyView") }],
  navItem: { label: "My Feature", icon: "star", path: "/myfeature" },
  slots: { right: [MyWidget] },
  // appName: "My App",  // optional: gate on Hubzilla app installation
});
```

Modules are auto-imported via `import.meta.glob()` — no changes to core files needed.
